<h1>Roller Ball Escape!</h1>
These are scriptes that I developed for use in my game Roller Ball Escape. <br>
The final project for 3D Simulation class at CVTC was to develop and design a game in Unity.<br>
<p>Below is my version of Roller Ball Escape!</p>

<h3>Level 1: The Beginning</h3>
<p>This was the very first level for class.  Although the course is short, I made sure to still include a little challenge for getting the best time or an alternate route if you didn't make the jump.</p>

<h3>Level 2: The Drop</h3>
<p>This level was where I had a lot of fun designing the bridge in Blender and getting the floor to drop out on you.  This is also a shorter level, but I was able to add more realism to the environment, as well as a toggle to turn on evening mode that includes music and fancy lighting.</p>

<h3>Level 3: The Final Escape</h3>
<p>This was the final level that I created in class, where I was able to incorporate everything I have learned from class as well as my additional research online.</p>
<p>I was able to incorporate functionality to pick up/drop/throw specific objects, work with splines for the ball to travel to different buildings, particle systems, and a puzzle.<p>

<p>Designing and developing this game in a few weeks was a lot of fun, and I definitely look forward to developing another game in the future.</p>
